tzphp - A small php library for looking up time in remote timezones.
Copyright (C) 2005 Donald Becker

tzphp is a small php library using data from the Olson timezone database.
The tz_localtime() function, acts like that of the localtime() php function.
Two arguments are passed to tz_localtime(), a time, and a timezone name from 
the Olson database. The returned array is NOT associative.  The array entries
are as follows:

  0 - seconds
  1 - minutes
  2 - hour
  3 - day of the month
  4 - month of the year, starting with 0 for January
  5 - Years since 1900
  6 - Day of the week
  7 - Day of the year
  9 - Is daylight savings time in effect

Example usage:

  <?php
    include('tz.php');
    $rtime = tz_localtime(time(), "America/Chicago");
    echo sprintf("%02d/%02d/%d %02d:%02d:%02d\n", 
      $rtime[4]+1, $rtime[3], $rtime[5]+1900, $rtime[2], $rtime[1], $rtime[0]);
  ?>

See example.php for another example.
